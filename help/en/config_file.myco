= Configuration file
//This article is intended for wiki administrators.//

The main way to configure your Mycorrhiza instance is through the **configuration file**. It is located at the root of your wiki structure and is called `config.ini`.

The file is generated automatically when you create a new wiki:

```
# Generate a new wiki
$ mycorrhiza bestWiki
...
# See what's inside
$ ls bestWiki
cache		config.ini	static		wiki.git
```

The file is written in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file | .ini format]].

== Example configuration
The auto-generated file is the best example (it has comments too).

Here's another example:
```ini
WikiName = My wiki
NaviTitleIcon = üêë

[Hyphae]
HomeHypha = home
UserHypha = u
HeaderLinksHypha = header-links

[Network]
HTTPPort = 8080
URL = https://wiki
GeminiCertificatePath = /home/wiki/gemcerts

[Authorization]
UseRegistration = true
```

== Fields
=== Root section
* `WikiName`: //string//. The name your wiki has. It is shown in the header by default and in other places. **Default:** `Mycorrhiza Wiki`.
* `NaviTitleIcon`: //string//. The icon shown before the colon in the navigational titles above each hypha. You may want to use an emoji or HTML here. **Default:** `üçÑ` (mushroom emoji).

=== [Hyphae]
* `HomeHypha`: //string//. The name your home hypha has. **Default:** `home`.
* `UserHypha`: //string//. The name of the hypha that is parent of all user hyphae. **Default:** `u`.
* `HeaderLinkHypha`: //string//. The name of the hypha where you can configure the header. There is no default.

=== [Network]
* `HTTPPort`: //number//. What port is used for serving the web interface of Mycorrhiza. **Default:** `1737`.
* `URL`: //url//. What URL is used for Opengraph and Web feed in the web interface. There is no default and you really should set it to something.

=== [Authorization]
* `UseRegistration`: //boolean//. Whether you want unregistered visitors to be able to register themselves using the web form. **Default:** `false`.
* `LimitRegistration`: //number//. There cannot be more registered users than this number. If the number is zero, there is no limit. Makes sense only when `UseRegistration` is `true`. **Default:** `0`.

* `CommonScripts`: //list of url//. Comma-separated list of unquoted URLs to JS files to load on //all// pages.
* `ViewScripts`: //list of urls//. Comma-separated list of unquoted URLs to JS files to load on //view// pages: `/hypha`, `/rev`.
