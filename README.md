# mycorrhiza wiki
A wiki engine inspired by fungi. Not production-ready.

Current version: 0.7 (or more?)

## Current features
* Edit pages through html forms
* Responsive design
* Works in text browsers
* Pages (called hyphae) can be in gemtext.
* Everything is stored as simple files, no database required

## Future features
* Tags
* Authorization
* History view
* Granular user rights

## Installation
I guess you can just clone this repo and run `make` to play around with the default wiki.
