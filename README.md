## Building
```sh

cd mycorrhiza
make
# That make will:

# * create an executable called `mycorrhiza`. Run it with path to your wiki.
```

## Usage
```
mycorrhiza [OPTIONS...] WIKI_PATH

Options:
  -auth-method string
        What auth method to use. Variants: "none", "fixed" (default "none")
  -fixed-credentials-path string
        Used when -auth-method=fixed. Path to file with user credentials. (default "mycocredentials.json")

## Features
* Edit pages through html forms
* Responsive design
* Works in text browsers
* Wiki pages (called hyphae) are written in mycomarkup
* Everything is stored as simple files, no database required. You can run a wiki on almost any directory and get something to work with.
* Page trees
* Changes are saved to git
* List of hyphae page
* History page
* Random page
* Recent changes page
* Hyphae can be deleted (while still preserving history)
* Hyphae can be renamed (recursive renaming of subhyphae is also supported)
* Light on resources: I run a home wiki on this engine 24/7 at an [Orange œÄ Lite](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepilite/).
