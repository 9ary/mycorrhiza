# MycorrhizaWiki
A wiki engine inspired by fungi.

## Current features
* Edit pages through html forms
* Responsive design
* Works in text browsers
* Pages (called hyphae) are in gemtext
* Everything is stored as simple files, no database required
* Page trees

* History page

## Future features
* Tags
* Authorization
* History view
* Granular user rights
* A better page tree algorithm

## Installation
I guess you can just clone this repo and run `make` to play around with the default wiki.
