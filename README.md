# mycorrhiza wiki
A wiki engine inspired by fungi. Not production-ready.

Current version: 0.5 (or more?)

## Current features
* Edit pages through html forms
* Responsive design
* Theme support (no themes other than the default one implemented though)
* Works in text browsers
* Pages (called hyphae) can be written in markdown, creole or geminitext.
* Two types of plugins: parsers (for supporting more markup languages) and languages (for i18n)
* Change history is saved and can be viewed (no nice way to do this yet, it can be done by changing url only)
* Namespaces called mycelia
* Everything is stored as simple files, no database required

## Future features
* Tags
* Authorization
* History view
* Granular user rights

## Installation
I guess you can just clone this repo and run `make` to play around with the default wiki.
