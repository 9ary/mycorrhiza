# üçÑ MycorrhizaWiki 0.9
A wiki engine.

## Building
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/bouncepaw/mycorrhiza
cd mycorrhiza
make
# That make will:
# * run the default wiki. You can edit it right away.
# * create an executable called `mycorrhiza`. Run it with path to your wiki.
```

## Features
* Edit pages through html forms
* Responsive design
* Works in text browsers
* Wiki pages (called hyphae) are in gemtext
* Everything is stored as simple files, no database required
* Page trees
* Changes are saved to git
* List of hyphae page
* History page
* Random page
* Recent changes page
* Hyphae can be deleted (while still preserving history)
* Hyphae can be renamed (recursive renaming of subhyphae is also supported)
* Light on resources: I run a home wiki on this engine 24/7 at an [Orange œÄ Lite](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepilite/).
